Phoenix hired me to take a data drive to a contact on Rockhome. The meet went south and I was attacked by the authority there. I went back to Burnell and took the data drive to Phoenix. The original client had asked to have it returned in the event it couldn't be delivered.

I went to Providence where I met Lux, the original client. He told me the data drive was a map to a hidden Precoursor vault beneath Flint Two. I wanted a blood analysis run on a sample of mine that I had taken, and he said he'd do it in exchange for exploring the vault.

I've retrieved the spacetime device from the [[Machine Vault]], now I have to find my way back out to return it to [[Lux Archer]].
